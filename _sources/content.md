This is my port of study notes to something that is easily awailable from the web. In general it covers:

1. Machine Learning
   1. [Bayesian stats](notes/bayesian_statistics.md)
2. Math
3. [Physics](notes/physics.md)
4. Algorithms

The general idea is to have small notes covering a single topic. This is still work in progress, since most of my previous notes are rather large documents, that need some breaking up, simplifying or extending to be easier to grasp.
