# Back propagation

It is a special version of [reverse mode accumulation](automatic_differentiation.md) automatic differentiation technique used in [neural networks](neural_networks.md)

## Performance
For chain structure neural networks it is $O(n)$. 

The works case performance for a n node network is $O(n^2)$.
