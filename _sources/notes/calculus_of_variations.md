# Calculus of variations

* **Functional** is a function of a function, 
    $$
    J[f]
    $$
*  taking the derivative of the functional with respect to individual values of the function $f(x)$ at any specific value $x$ is known as **variational derivatives** of the functional 
  $$\frac{\delta}{\delta f(x)} $$
