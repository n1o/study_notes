# Higher order derivatives in neural networks

In deep learning the [hessian](hessian.md) is not feasible to represent. 

## Krylov methods

Are iterative techniques to preform various operations such as approximating matrix inversion, approximating eigenvectors (eigenvalues) using only matrix vector products.
