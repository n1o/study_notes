# Sufficient statistics

It meas that a distribution can be sumarized by a finite set of statistics. The number of these statistics does not grow with sample size. And they are independent of the size of the data.

[Pitman Koopman Darmols theorem](pitman_koopman_darmois_exponential_family_mle.md)  states that sufficient statistic only exists for the [exponential family](exponential_family.md).
