# Drag Force
If we fall in air, the air pushes back. This air resistance is approximately proportional to the square of objects speed:

$$
F_D = Dv^2
$$

* D is proportionality constant depending on the objects shape and air density

After falling we reach terminal velocity. By [second newtons law](newtons_laws.md) this is defined as:

$$
\sum F_y = ma_y \\ 
mg - Dv_y^2 = ma_y
$$

Since at terminal velocity the acceleration $a_y = 0$ (do not accelerate) we get:

$$
mg - Dv_y^2 = 0 \\
v_t = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{D}}
$$
