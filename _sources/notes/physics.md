# Physics

## [One dimensional movement](one_dimensional_motion.md)

## [Motion in a plane](motion_in_plane.md)
Here we move in a plane represented by x,y coordinates.

### [Projectile motion](projectile_motion.md)
Here a projective given an initial velocity follows a path determined by the effect of gravity and air resistance

### [Uniform circular Motion](uniform_circular_motion.md
Movement in a circle with constant speed.

## [Force](force.md)
Here we describe interactions between objects or objects and nature.
### [Newtons laws](newtons_laws.md)
First law states than an object travels at constant velocity (or rest) if no forces is acted upon. 

Second tels us the relationship between Force mass and acceleration. 

The Third law is about equilibrium, every force has an equal opposite reaction.
### [Contact force](contact_force_friction.md)
Describes forces that an object excerpts when we try to move it. If we pull/push an object it will excerpt friction, that is in the opposite direction of the acted forces.
### [Drag Force](drag_force.md)
If something falls in the air, there is drag. Drag pushes an object back.

### [Elastic Forces](elastic_forces.md)
Here we study the behavior of springs, how they expand and contract under force.

### [Four fundamental forces of nature](forces_in_nature.md

### [Newtons Law of gravitation](newtons_law_of_gravitation.md)
Here we define the gravitation between two objects their masses, distance between them and the gravitational constant.

### [Weight of an object](weight.md)
The weight of an object is the total [gravitational force](newtons_law_of_gravitation.md) excreted on the object by all the other objects in the universe.

### [Satellite motion](satellite_motion.md)
