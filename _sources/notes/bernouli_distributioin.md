# Bernoulli distribution
A bernouli random variable is a random variable that can take up two mutually exclusive states $(0,1)$
$$
X \sim Ber(p)
$$
* $0 \le p \le 1$

With probability:

$$
p(x) \begin{cases}
    p, & \text{ if } x = 1 \\
    1 - p & \text{ if } x = 0
\end{cases}
$$

## Bernoulli trial
Is an experiment which results in either an success or a failure. An Bernoulli random variable acts as an indicator of success.
