# Mechanical Energy
Mechanical energy is energy associated with motion position and deformation. Kinds of mechanical energy:

* kinetic energy is the energy that is associated with motion
* potential energy, is energy stored in an object that can be transformed to a different type of energy
  * elastic potential energy - is energy stored in an elastic object (stretched rubber)
  * gravitational potential energy - energy that is stored in an object that is about to fall

## Dissipation of Mechanical energy
Real world systems allow mechanical energy to transform into non-mechanical, in most cases objects transform mechanical energy into head.

The hotter the object, the more strongly its molecules vibrate. This random atomic scale vibration is called internal energy and it consists of kinetic and potential energies of atoms.

Friction turns mechanical into non-mechanical forms of energy called dissipative force (dissipates) reduces mechanical energy into other forms.
