# Uninformative prior
In case if we do not have a strong belief about our prior, we should let the **data speak for itself**. This is a prior that has only weak influence on the data.

Unfortunatelly coosing a uninformative prior can be hard, but there is a general purpose technique, whichs result is called the [Jeffreys prior](jeffrey_prior.md).

In general it is a good practice to perform **sensitivity analysis**. This is to check how sensitive our model is to change of prior.
