# Work

When an object undergoes displacement $\vec{s}$ with magnitude s along a straight line, while a constant force $\vec{F}$ with magnitude F, making an angle $\phi$ with $s$ acts on the object, the work done by the force on the object is defined:

$$
w = F_{\parallel}s = F(\cos \phi) s
$$

Units of work:

$$ \text{J} = \text{N} \cdot \text{m} $$

One Joul = Newton $\cdot$ meter. Joul is scalar, and ti can be negative, if the force that we apply is under angle $90 < \phi < 270$, thus we try to stop an moving object.

If an object is sliding, the work done by the normal force is 0, (there is no upward motion). If an object is moving in a circle, the work done by the normal force is zero.

## Work and kinetic energy

Lets assume a particle undergoes constant acceleration from $v_i$ to $v_f$ during displacement s, the final velocity can be expressed as:

$$
v^2_f = v_i^2 + as \\ 
a = \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2s}
$$
The force acting on a particle with mass $m$ is:

$$
F_{\text{total}} = m a \\ 
= m \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2s}
$$

From this we can define the work done by a particle:

$$
F_{\text{total}} s = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2  
$$


From this we can define the kinetic  energy of a particle:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

* $K > 0$ no matter what

Thus if we apply force we can change the kinetic energy of an object. The total work is the difference between the final and initial kinetic energy.

$$
W_{\text{total}} = K_f - K_i = \Delta K
$$
