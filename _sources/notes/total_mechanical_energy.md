# Total mechanical energy

Lets assume an object is falling at point $y_i$ it has speed $y_i$ at $y_f$ its speed is $v_f$. The total work done is:

$$
W_{\text{total}} = K_f - K_i
$$

And since the object is falling 

$$
W_{\text{total}} = W_{\text{grav}} \\ 
K_f - K_i = U_i - U_f \\ 
K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f \\ 
\frac{1}{2} mv_i^2 + mgy_i = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2 + mgy_f
$$

Thus the total mechanical energy is:

$$
E = K + U \\
E_i = K_i + U_i \space \text{ energy at } y_i  \\
E_f = K_f + U_f \space \text{ energy at } y_f
$$

By energy [conservation](conservation_of_energy.md) we have $E_i = E_f$ thus E is constant at any $y_i$ if there is no other energy $\sum \vec{F}_{\text{other}} = 0$

The intuition is that if we throw a object up, the kinetic energy is always converted to potential energy and vice versa.
