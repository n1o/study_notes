# Likelihood principle

The likelihood priniciple states, that the inference should be based on the likelihood $P(D|\theta)$ of the observed data, not based on hypothetical future dta that we have not observed. 

The likelihood principle can be decomposed into two simpler principles:

1. **Sufficiency principle**
   This states that [sufficient statistics](./sufficient_statistics.md) contain all the relevant information about an unknown parameter (this is true by definition)
2. **Weak conditionality**
   This states that inference should be based on events that have happend and not on which might have happend.
