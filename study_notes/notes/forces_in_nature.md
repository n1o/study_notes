# Forces in nature
There are 4 fundamental forces of nature. 

1. Gravitational interaction
2. Electromagnetic interactions
3. Strong interactions (nuclear force)
4. Weak interactions


## Gravitational interaction

It is the interaction between celestial bodies, and it defines the weight of an object. This force is however negligible on molecular level.

## Electromagnetic interactions
This is the combination of electric and magnetic forces.

## Strong interactions (nuclear force)
This is the force that holds atoms together. A nucleus of atom contains neutral and positively charged particles. This particles repel each other. Strong interaction cancels this interactions. 

The range is shorter than electromagnetic interaction, but it is much stronger.

It is responsible for creating unstable particles in high energy particle collisions.

## Weak interactions

It has no direct influence, but is important for behavior of fundamental particles. 

It is responsible for beta decay (kind of nuclear radiation). An the decay of unstable particles.
