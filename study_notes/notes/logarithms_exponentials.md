# Logarithms and exponentials
In logarithms we ask to what power we must raise the base to get y. If we have a base 10 logarithm:

$$
y = 10^{\log y} \\
\log y = x \\
y = 10^x
$$

## Natural logarithm
Here the base is $e$

$$
y = e^{\ln y} \\
\ln y = x \\
y = e^x
$$

## Rules
$$
\log (ab) = \log a + \log b \\
\log (a/b) = \log a - \log b \\
\log(a^n) = n \log(a) \\
\log(1/a) = \log(1) - \log(a) = 0 - \log(a)
$$
