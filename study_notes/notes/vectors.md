# Vector

Vector is an entity that has an magnitude and orientation. 


## Magintude
It is just the L2 norm of a vector.
$$
|\vec{A}| = \sqrt{\sum A_i^2}
$$

## Similar vectors
Two vectors are similar if they point in the same direction and have the same magnitude. They **do not have to start at the same point**. 

## Vector addition

$$
\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B} \\
C_i = A_i + B_i
$$

We perform element vise addition.
