# Distributed representation

* representation that is composed of many elements that can be set separately form each other
* use $k$ features with $n$ values to describe $k^n$ different concepts
* each direction in representation space corresponds to a different value of the underlying configuration

The idea is that we transform a symbol (in NLP it would be a word) to a distributed representation, where semantically close concepts are close together in distance.

The distributed representation can represent complex things using a small number of parameters.
