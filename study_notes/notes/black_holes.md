# Black Holes

A black hole is a matter so dense that even light cannot escape.

## Schvarzchild radius $R_s$

If an aggregation of matter with total mass M has radius less than a critical value $R_s$, than nothing cannot escape from its gravitational pull.

$$
R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
$$

The event horizon is a sphere with radius $R_s$ around a black hole.
