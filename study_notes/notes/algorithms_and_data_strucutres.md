## [Trees](trees.md)
A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically. Each element with expect the top element has an parent, and zero or more children. The top element of a tree is called the root of the tree. 

### [Binary tree](binary_tree.md)
Here each node has at most two children

### [Search Trees](search_trees.md)
These are specific trees to perform an element lookup.
