# Power

* Time rate at which work is done

The average power 

$$
P_{\text{av}} = \frac{\Delta w}{\Delta t}
$$

* $\Delta w$ is the average quantity of work done
* $\Delta t$ is the time interval

## Units of Power
$$
\text{Wat} = \frac{\text{Joule}}{\text{second}}
$$

## Instantaneous power

$$
P = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta w}{\Delta t}
$$

If forces act on a moving object, we can express the corresponding power in terms of force and velocity:

$$
P_{\text{av}} = \frac{F_{\parallel} \Delta s}{\Delta t} = F_{\parallel} v_{\text{av}}
$$
* $\Delta s$ is the magnitude of displacement $\Delta \vec{s}$

Int the limit we get the instantaneous work:

$$
P = F_{\parallel} v
$$
