## [One dimensional movement](one_dimensional_motion.md)

## [Motion in a plane](motion_in_plane.md)
Here we move in a plane represented by x,y coordinates.

### [Projectile motion](projectile_motion.md)
Here a projective given an initial velocity follows a path determined by the effect of gravity and air resistance

### [Uniform circular Motion](uniform_circular_motion.md
Movement in a circle with constant speed.
