# Newtons law of gravitation

Every particle of matter in the universe affects every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

$$
F_g = G \frac{m_1m2}{r^2}
$$

* $m_1$ is the mass of the first object
* $m_2$ is the mass of the second object
* $G=6.674 \times 10^{-11}$ is the gravitational constant

The gravitational force between familiar objects (car, dog) is small, it grows as objects get heavier.
